# Multi-Factor Equity Analysis Dashboard

Interactive Power BI dashboard for equity investment analysis combining fundamental valuation (DCF modeling), financial ratio analysis, and risk assessment frameworks. Developed comprehensive financial models incorporating profitability metrics (ROE, ROIC, EBITDA margins), growth indicators (revenue growth, FCF yield), and risk quantification (VaR, drawdown analysis) to generate data-driven investment recommendations and portfolio allocation strategies.

## Project Overview

This project implements a systematic approach to equity analysis by integrating multiple financial frameworks:

### Key Components

**1. DCF Valuation Model**
- Calculates intrinsic value using discounted cash flow analysis
- Determines if stocks are undervalued or overvalued relative to fundamentals
- Incorporates WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) and terminal growth rates
- Generates upside/downside potential metrics

**2. Fundamental Quality Scoring**
- **Profitability Assessment**: EBITDA margins, net margins, ROE, ROIC
- **Growth Evaluation**: Revenue growth rates, free cash flow yield
- **Financial Health**: Debt-to-equity ratios, interest coverage, current ratios
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Asset turnover analysis

**3. Risk Assessment Framework**
- Volatility analysis using rolling standard deviations
- Drawdown metrics (current and maximum historical)
- Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
- Beta and market correlation analysis
- Composite risk scoring (0-100 scale)

**4. Decision Aggregation System**
- Synthesizes valuation, quality, and risk metrics
- Generates BUY/HOLD/SELL recommendations
- Calculates optimal position sizing based on risk-adjusted returns
- Provides actionable investment signals with confidence scores

## Technical Indicators Analyzed

- **Price Momentum**: 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day returns
- **Technical Signals**: RSI (14-period), MACD, SMA/EMA distances
- **Volatility Measures**: 20-day rolling volatility (annualized)
- **Risk Metrics**: Maximum drawdown, correlation to market index

## Financial Metrics Evaluated

- Revenue Growth (YoY)
- EBITDA Margin
- Net Profit Margin
- Return on Equity (ROE)
- Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)
- Debt-to-Equity Ratio
- Free Cash Flow Yield
- Interest Coverage Ratio
- Asset Turnover
- Current Ratio

## Output Metrics

- **Decision Score**: Aggregated score (0-100 scale) combining all factors
- **Recommendation**: Clear BUY/HOLD/SELL signal
- **Position Size**: Suggested portfolio allocation percentage (risk-adjusted)
- **DCF Upside**: Percentage difference between intrinsic value and current price

## Applications

- Equity portfolio construction and optimization
- Investment screening and stock selection
- Risk management and position sizing
- Fundamental and technical analysis integration
- Data-driven investment decision support

## Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard development and data visualization
- **Financial Modeling**: DCF valuation, ratio analysis, risk quantification
- **Data Analysis**: Excel for financial calculations and metric normalization
